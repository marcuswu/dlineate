- [x] Return details about under / over constrained elements
- [x] Rework pkg/Solver to use maps to handle findConstraint(s)
- [x] Add SVG export functionality to visualize input and output
- [-] Build out some core examples / tests
  - [x] Fix square example -- internal solver tests succeed, but using pkg/ fails... something wrong with interface
        Or something is wrong with internal that is exposed via how the interface is using it
  - [X] Add / fix distance constraint for a line
  - [X] Figure out how to handle origin and axes
  - [X] Fix tests
  - [X] Build out the pentagon example
  - [X] Build out the BellSketch from the curta II project
  - [X] Add identifiers to clusters and use for logging and graphviz output
  - [X] Fix compound elements (adding too many internal elements)
  - [ ] Fix resolution of curve radius constraints
  - [ ] Rework cluster creation to generate a map of shared elements
  - [ ] Rework merging to utilize shared element map
  - [ ] Make cluster creation start with next available constraint instead of a shared constraint
  - [ ] Update unit tests
    - [ ] SolveDistanceConstraint 0 distance translate
  - [ ] Get the BellSketch working
  - [ ] Add horizontal, vertical constraints
- [x] Load element values from solver when solved
- [x] External interface should take two passes. One to solve independent constraints. One to solve dependent.
- [x] Ratio & equality lengths are dependent constraints
