- [x] Return details about under / over constrained elements
- [x] Rework pkg/Solver to use maps to handle findConstraint(s)
- [x] Add SVG export functionality to visualize input and output
- [-] Build out some core examples / tests
  - [x] Fix square example -- internal solver tests succeed, but using pkg/ fails... something wrong with interface
        Or something is wrong with internal that is exposed via how the interface is using it
  - [X] Add / fix distance constraint for a line
  - [X] Figure out how to handle origin and axes
  - [X] Fix tests
  - [ ] Build out the pentagon example
  - [ ] Build out the BellSketch from the curta II project
- [x] Load element values from solver when solved
- [x] External interface should take two passes. One to solve independent constraints. One to solve dependent.
- [x] Ratio & equality lengths are dependent constraints
